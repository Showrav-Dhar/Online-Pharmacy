While Working On the project we learned about UI/UX, how users interacts with a website, how to make the user interaction better by sorting out the products, how to use bootstrap to make the ui look more clean and interactive and the most important -  the ** django MVT architecture**. MVT is a software design pattern for developing a web application. It consists of the following three entities:
      Model : The Model manages the data and is represented by a database. 
      View  : The View receives HTTP requests and sends HTTP responses. A view interacts with a model and template to complete a response.
      Template : The Template is basically the front-end layer and the dynamic HTML component of a Django application.
            

PS : This project was made as a learning purpose and to explore how a fullstack project works.
